            One of Naruto’s famous sayings was “Real strength is not what you have when fighting for only yourself. When
            you
            have something special that you want to protect, only then can you become truly strong!” (Lina, 2015). This
            is
            one of Naruto Uzumaki’s famous inspirational quotes throughout the Japanese series Naruto, Naruto Shippuden,
            and
            Boruto. During the series of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden, Naruto Uzumaki ends up fighting his way to the
            top,
            achieving his goal, and becoming known as the seventh Hokage. Naruto and Naruto Shippuden are about a ninja
            named Naruto Uzumaki who goes on several missions with his friends and mentor and has grown throughout the
            series becoming a very powerful ninja through training and battles. Naruto Uzumaki proves to have gone
            through
            several character developments and has grown overall throughout the series. Naruto has shown his growth
            throughout the series from a 12/13-year-old boy who is learning more about what he wants to become in the
            future
            and his abilities, to a 17-year-old teenager who is determined to become a strong-willed ninja and become
            the
            Hokage, to a ninja possessed by the nine-tailed fox, and finally to a teenage boy who finally learned to
            control
            his power and become known as the 7th Hokage.

            In “Naruto”, the viewers are introduced to the protagonist who is named Naruto Uzumaki. In the beginning,
            Naruto Uzumaki was a kid who was reckless and caused trouble to the grown-ups not caring about the
            consequences. He is proven troublesome toward the grownups while he lived in the village. In the anime,
            Naruto has blonde hair that is spiky and blue eyes. He also has some form of whiskers on the sides of his
            face. He wore an orange jumpsuit and wore a pair of goggles on his head to substitute as a head protector
            that is given to shinobis when they pass a test in school. Throughout the series, Naruto is shown to be
            determined to become a shinobi and become the Hokage, but people do not believe he could live up to his
            dreams because he could not summon clones for the test and become a ninja. But through determination and his
            strong personality, he ends up proving everyone wrong and gets his headband which shows he is a shinobi. As
            said before, Naruto wore an orange jumpsuit where the orange could represent his enthusiasm and
            determination throughout the series. The blue that is on his shoulders could represent his confident,
            trustworthy, and loyal personality. As the series goes on, Naruto makes two friends who are introduced as
            the other main characters, Sasuke and Sakura, and the viewers can notice the difference between each
            character. But later in the series, as Sasuke Uchiha and Naruto started to become closer, Sasuke ends up
            leaving and betraying Naruto Uzumaki.

        <h1>Heading 3</h1>
        <p>3 years later, Naruto comes back to the village, where he is welcomed back and reunited with his friends. The
            viewers can see the changes in Naruto’s new outfit and how he has matured and become wiser. Naruto Uzumaki’s
            new jumpsuit only contains two colors, black, and orange. As the viewers can see, the blue from his previous
            outfit was gone. This could symbolize Naruto’s lack of trust and faith. Since his best friend Sasuke Uchiha
            betrayed him, he feels that he was betrayed and lost his trust in his best friend. But he still has a
            strong-minded personality and is determined to get his friend back. This shows his determination through the
            color orange in his new outfit. But the black in his outfit portrays death and power. Throughout the Naruto
            Shippuden Series, Naruto goes through and experiences several deaths such as his mentor, Jiraiya who was one
            of his closest friends and teacher. But through those deaths, he became powerful and more determined to
            defeat the enemy. This shows how through his outfits people can notice how the colors are portrayed
            throughout the series and symbolize several meanings. But viewers can also see the similarities in Naruto
            throughout the series, such as how he is always dressed in jumpsuits and how he always wears orange and his
            headband. This can illustrate to the viewers how even though Naruto Uzumaki is growing up and becoming wiser
            and stronger, some parts of him will stay constant and symbolize how his determination is what made him
            stronger as he grew.</p>
