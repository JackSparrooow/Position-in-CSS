            ONE PIECE is a legendary high-seas quest unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed
            for a life of freedom ever since he can remember. He sets off from his small village on a perilous
            journey to find the legendary fabled treasure, ONE PIECE, to become King of the Pirates! But in order to
            find the ultimate prize, he’ll need to assemble the crew he’s always wanted before finding a ship to
            sail, searching every inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines and outwitting dangerous rivals
            at every turn.
