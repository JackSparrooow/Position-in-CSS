Relative Positioning:-When you set the position relative to an element, 
without adding any other positioning attributes (top, bottom, right, left) nothing will happen.
 When you add an additional position apart from relative, such as left: 
20px the element will move 20px to the right from its normal position.
 Here, you can see that this element is relative to itself.
 When the element moves, no other element on the layout will be affected.

Absolute positioniong:-Absolute positioning allows you to place your element precisely where you want it.
Absolute positioning is done relative to the first relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent element.
 In the case when there is no positioned parent element, 
the element that has position set to absolute will be positioned related directly to the HTML element (the page itself).
